# PyBRISQUE
An implementation of BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality 
Evaluator) in Python from the paper: ["No-Reference Image Quality Assessment 
in the Spatial Domain"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6272356/).


## Installation
LibSVM is required. On ubuntu or other debian-based system, you can install ```libsvm-dev``` package from apt as follows:

```apt-get install libsvm-dev```

The package is in PyPI so you can install it simply by this command:

```pip install --process-dependency-links pybrisque```

## Usage
Initialize once:
```
brisq = BRISQUE()
```
and get the BRISQUE feature or score many times:
```
brisq.get_feature('/path')
brisq.get_score('/image_path')
```


## Limitations
This implementation is heavily adopted from the original Matlab 
implementation in [here](https://github.com/dsoellinger/blind_image_quality_toolbox/tree/master/%2Bbrisque). There is one catch though, the bicubic interpolation when resizing image in 
Matlab and OpenCV is a bit different as explained in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26823140/imresize-trying-to-understand-the-bicubic-interpolation). For now, it uses ```nearest``` interpolation 
which gives the most similar output with the original implementation.
